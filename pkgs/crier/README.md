# Crier

A rudimentary [Desktop
Notifications](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/ar01s02.html)
server optimised for mobile form devices.

## TO DO

- implement default timeout for urgency in (low, normal)
- swipe to cancel
- find out if actions are supposed to cancel
- test multi-paragraph body and markup
- implement "image-data", "image-path" https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/ar01s05.html (is this required? it needs a hint, so maybe not)
